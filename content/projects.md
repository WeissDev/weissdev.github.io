A selection projects I am (/have been) involved with:

* **Human Pose Estimation** *2021*

  In the context of the Machine Perception course at ETH, we looked at several
  state-of-the-art neural network architectures for Human Pose Estimation from
  RGB images and built and trained our own architecture using Pytorch.

* **Road Segmentation** *2021*

  In the Computational Intelligence Lab at ETH, we worked on the task of detecting
  roads from aerial images inventing our own neural network architecture to tackle
  this task. Learn more [here](/report_eth_fs21_cil_project.pdf).
